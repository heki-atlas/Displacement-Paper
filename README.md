# Displacement-Paper
Code used for data evaluation in: doi:

The code was run on Linux Mint 22.1.

1. Conda was used in this project, so install conda first (e.g. via [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)). (pip can of course be used as an alternative)
2. Create environment (commands for shell)
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
3.

In order for the plotting to work, certain dependency requirements need to be met. 
For this purpose, a conda environment with the specified versions was created.
